# Portfolio Fixes Summary

## üîß Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Loading Screen Issues**
- **Problem**: Components were stuck on "Loading..." screens
- **Solution**: Removed problematic lazy loading imports and switched back to direct imports
- **Fixed Files**:
  - `components/sections/HeroSection.tsx`
  - `components/sections/AboutSection2.tsx`
  - `components/sections/SkillsSection2.tsx`

### 2. **Audio Auto-Play**
- **Problem**: Background music wasn't playing automatically
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated `AudioProvider.tsx` to attempt autoplay immediately
  - Fixed audio file path from long filename to `/music.mp3`
  - Added fallback to wait for user interaction if autoplay fails
- **Fixed Files**:
  - `components/providers/AudioProvider.tsx`

### 3. **Missing Icons**
- **Problem**: Multiple components were importing from non-existent `@/components/icons`
- **Solution**: Created comprehensive icons file re-exporting from lucide-react
- **Created**: `components/icons/index.ts`

### 4. **Removed Unwanted Elements**
- **Problem**: User reported unwanted "deploy thingy" and "flashing cards"
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed `FloatingChat` component from layout (was causing bottom-right flashing)
  - Removed `AICursor` component that had "Deploy" button
  - Removed `PerformanceMonitor` wrapper
  - Cleaned up layout to use only working components
- **Fixed Files**:
  - `app/layout.tsx`

### 5. **Layout Optimization**
- **Problem**: Layout was importing non-existent components
- **Solution**: Simplified layout to use only:
  - `CustomCursor` (working cursor)
  - `BackgroundMusic` (audio control)
  - `AudioProvider` (audio context)
  - `ThemeProvider` (theme context)
- **Fixed Files**:
  - `app/layout.tsx`
